# Currency Converter

## Description

### Header with Currency Exchange Rates

The header should display the current exchange rates (USD, EUR) relative to the
Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH). The current exchange rates should be fetched from any
public API.

### Conversion Component

Each currency should have its own input and select elements. Separate input +
select for the first currency, and a separate input + select for the second
currency. Enter a number in the input to specify the amount for conversion. The
select element should include at least three currencies - UAH, USD, EUR.
Conversion should occur in both directions. When the value in the first currency
changes, the value in the second currency should be recalculated, and vice
versa. When the currency changes in each select element, the conversion for both
currencies should be recalculated correctly.

## Bonus

- Well-thought-out interface and appearance.
- Clean code.
